PolyDiag AI is a machine-learning based web application designed to predict three major health conditions Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson s Disease using clinically relevant input features. The system uses well-known medical datasets and applies supervised learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression to generate reliable predictions. The project integrates all three models into a single user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input medical values and instantly view the prediction results. The goal of PolyDiag AI is to demonstrate how machine learning can support early disease detection and assist healthcare processes through automated decision systems. The application is deployed on Render Cloud, enabling easy online access without local installation. This repository contains all necessary model files, preprocessing steps, and UI implementation so the project can be reused, studied, or extended by developers and students working in the field of medical AI.
